# Coffeephile Schema

## Background

The idea for this API project came from a pure desire to better appreciate craft coffees and their stories. As such, there are two focal points in the schema currently:

- Origins (bean type/geography/prominent roasteries)
- Brews (techniques and equipment)

Each origin can have many brews associated with it, and brews may be associated or differentiated based on the equipment or bean origin.
